# Provision virtual machine
A role to provision a virtual machine, create associated resources if they don't exist (subnets, vCPU, memory configuration, storage configuration, etc)
This includes cloning and building from VM templates.


## Requirements 
N/A


## Role Variables
### Auth
- **provision_vm_username**: (string, Required)
  - The vSphere vCenter username.

- **provision_vm_password**: (string, Required)
  - The vSphere vCenter password.

- **provision_vm_hostname**: (string, Required)
  - The hostname or IP address of the vSphere vCenter.

- **provision_vm_validate_certs** (boolean)
  - Allows connection when SSL certificates are not valid. Set to false when certificates are not trusted.

- **provision_vm_port** (integer):
    The port number of the vSphere vCenter or ESXi server.
    If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable VMWARE_PORT will be used instead.
    Default: 443

- **provision_vm_proxy_host** (string):
    Address of a proxy that will receive all HTTPS requests and relay them.
    The format is a hostname or a IP.
    If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable VMWARE_PROXY_HOST will be used instead.

- **provision_vm_proxy_port** (integer):
    Port of the HTTP proxy that will receive all HTTPS requests and relay them.
    If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable VMWARE_PROXY_PORT will be used instead.

### Provisioning a VM
- **provision_vm_name**  (string, Required):
    Name of the virtual machine to work with.
    Virtual machine names in vCenter are not necessarily unique, which may be problematic, see O(name_match).
    If multiple virtual machines with same name exists, then O(folder) is required parameter to
    identify uniqueness of the virtual machine.
    This parameter is required, if (state=poweredon), (state=powered-on), (state=poweredoff), (state=powered-off),
    (state=present), (state=restarted), (state=suspended) and virtual machine does not exists.
    This parameter is case sensitive.

- **provision_vm_uuid**  (string):
    UUID of the virtual machine to manage if known, this is VMware's unique identifier.
    This is required if O(name) is not supplied.
    If virtual machine does not exists, then this parameter is ignored.
    Please note that a supplied UUID will be ignored on virtual machine creation, as VMware creates the UUID internally.

- **provision_vm_cluster** (String):
    The cluster name where the virtual machine will run.

- **provision_vm_esxi_hostname** (string):
    The ESXi hostname where the virtual machine will run.
    This is a required parameter, if cluster is not set.
    esxi_hostname and cluster are mutually exclusive parameters.

    Destination folder, absolute path to find an existing guest or create the new guest.
    The folder should include the datacenter. ESXi's datacenter is ha-datacenter.
    This parameter is case sensitive.
    If multiple machines are found with same name, this parameter is used to identify
    uniqueness of the virtual machine.
  
- **provision_vm_datastore** (string):
    Specify datastore or datastore cluster to provision virtual machine.
    This parameter takes precedence over disk.datastore parameter.
    This parameter can be used to override datastore or datastore cluster setting of the virtual machine when deployed from the template.
    Please see example for more usage.

- **provision_vm_resource_pool** (string):
    Use the given resource pool for virtual machine operation.
    This parameter is case sensitive.
    Resource pool should be child of the selected host parent.
    When not specified Resources is taken as default value.

    If present and virtual machine exists, ensure the virtual machine configurations conforms to task arguments.
    If absent and virtual machine exists, then the specified virtual machine is removed with it's associated components.
    If set to one of poweredon, powered-on, poweredoff, powered-off, present, restarted, suspended and virtual machine does not exists, virtual machine is deployed with the given parameters.
    If set to poweredon or powered-on and virtual machine exists with powerstate other than powered on, then the specified virtual machine is powered on.
    If set to poweredoff or powered-off and virtual machine exists with powerstate other than powered off, then the specified virtual machine is powered off.
    If set to restarted and virtual machine exists, then the virtual machine is restarted.
    If set to suspended and virtual machine exists, then the virtual machine is set to suspended mode.
    If set to shutdownguest or shutdown-guest and virtual machine exists, then the virtual machine is shutdown.
    If set to rebootguest or reboot-guest and virtual machine exists, then the virtual machine is rebooted.

    Choices:
    - false ‚Üê (default)
    - true

- **provision_vm_wait_for_customization_timeout** (integer):
