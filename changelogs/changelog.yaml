  1.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - esxi_maintenance_mode - Fixed typo in the vmware_maintenancemode module's
        `evacuate`` attribute
      - provision_vcenter - Added dedicated complexity check for VM password at beginning
        of role. Complexity requirements are normally validated by the VCSA installer
        but the error thrown can be confusing. Update integration test to use proper
        password
      - provision_vcenter - Changed default ISO mount point from /mnt to /tmp, since
        /tmp is more likely to be writable
      - provision_vcenter - Install libnsl if running on rhel flavored OS, since it
        is not included in OS version 8+ but needed for the vmware ovftool
      - provision_vcenter - Remove leading slashes when a user provides a datacenter/target
        host path to the installer. These values are supposed to be vcenter folder
        paths (e.g. /cluster01/host01) but a leading slash would break the VCSA installer
        config
      - provision_vcenter - missing parameters in the validate_inputs tasks. Added
        them so the user will be alerted sooner if required parameters are missing
      - provision_vcenter - the vcsa deploy config was invalid json if dhcp was used.
        Re-ordered the network section of the config template to fix
      - provision_vcenter - vcenter vm names containing a string marked for no_log
        no longer trigger an unexpected error when checking if the vm already exists
      - provision_virtual_esxi - Added missing variable documentation
      - provision_virtual_esxi - Role had redundant variable `provision_virtual_esxi_iso_path`
        that was left from a name refactor. It was updated to match the new name.
        The new variable name `provision_virtual_esxi_datastore_iso_path` is already
        mandatory
      minor_changes:
      - Fix the README file of snapshot_management role to be more clear about the
        parameters `snapshot_management_folder` and  `snapshot_management_vm_name`
      - add_esxi_host_to_vcenter - Added new playbook to add an ESXi host to a vCenter
      - cluster_settings - Added new playbook to modify cluster settings
      - cluster_settings - Added new role for managing different cluster settings
        including DRM, DRS, vCLS, HA, and vSAN. Added integration tests for role
      - disable_high_availability - Added playbook to disable high availability in  a
        vcenter cluster
      - disable_maintenance_mode - Added new playbook to disable maintenance mode
        on an ESXi host
      - enable_high_availability - Added playbook to enable and configure high availability
        in a vcenter cluster
      - enable_maintenance_mode - Added new playbook to enable maintenance mode on
        an ESXi host
      - esxi_maintenance_mode - Added new role for setting an ESXi host's maintenance
        mode status. Added integration tests for role
      - info - Fix creation of temporary files
      - info - Fix the incorrect documentation
      - manage_all_settings - Renamed and moved ``cluster_settings.yml`` playbook
        to ``cluster_settings\manage_all_settings.yml``. New location is with other
        cluster settings related plays
      - provision_vcenter - Only use hdiutil to mount ISO on mac instead of hdiutil
        + mount. The new approach provides more consistent results when reading the
        ISO content as a file system
      - provision_vcenter - Use OS specific binary when deploying the VCSA appliance
        (mac vs generic linux) instead of always using linux
      - provision_vcenter - When running the playbook on MacOS, the `iso9660` file
        system is not supported. Instead, Macs need to mount the ISO as a block device
        and then mount it as `cd9660`. Added new tasks to perform these actions when
        the os family is darwin
      - provision_virtual_esxi - Added new role for provisioning a VM and installing
        ESXi on it. Added integration tests for role
      - reconnect_esxi_host_in_vcenter - Added new playbook to reconnect an ESXi host
        in a vCenter
      - remove_esxi_host_from_vcenter - Added new playbook to remove an ESXi host
        from a vCenter
      - snapshot_management - Add a new role and playbooks to manages virtual machines
        snapshots in vCenter. (https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.vmware_ops/pull/24)
      - vcenter_host_connection - Added role to manage the connection status of an
        ESXI host to a vcenter. Included integration tests for the role
