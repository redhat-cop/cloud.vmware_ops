### Testing and Development

The project uses `ansible-lint` and `black`.
Assuming this repository is checked out in the proper structure,
e.g. `collections_root/ansible_collections/cloud/vmware_ops/`, run:

```shell
  tox -e linters
```

Sanity and unit tests are run as normal:

```shell
  ansible-test sanity
```

#### Integration Tests

Currently integration tests are using vcsim, which is VMware SOAP API simulator. So no external infrastructure is needed.
Vcsim is executed in a podman container before the integration test is executed.

In order to run the integration tests, please follow:

```bash
make integration
```
